## Overview

### The challenge

Workout Manager provides an interactive interface for:

- **Mapping Workouts:** Leverage geolocation technology to pinpoint workout location directly on a map with a
  single click.
- **Creating Detailed Logs:** Capture workout details effortlessly by filling out forms and adding specifics like
  activity type, distance, and duration.
- **Seamless Editing:** Easily modify existing workout entries to ensure fitness records stay accurate and
  up-to-date.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - JavaScript mapping library
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Web application bundler
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - Deployment service

### What I learned

While working through this project, the major learnings involved:

- The integration of a geolocation API to create location-based features.
- The use of a mapping API to create interactive map experiences.
- The creation of ES6 modules and need for bundlers such as Parcel.
- The use of cloud platforms such as Vercel to quickly deploy web applications.

### Continued development

Even though I have accomplished many of my initial objectives for this
project, there are still some new features I wish to include such as:

- The use of a database to store data rather than rely on the localStorage.
- An authentication mechanism to allow user account.
- The display of further helpful data (e.g. the weather at a specific location).
- The creation of lines on the map to show the actual route used for a workout.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - This enhanced my knowledge of certain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts needed to complete the project.
- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - This proved insightful
  when I was stuck on specific coding issues.
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html) - This provided me with me the documentation necessary to integrate Leaflet's mapping technology into my project.
- [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) - This allowed me to quickly generate
  necessary files for the favicon and its different formats.
- [Parcel REPL](https://repl.parceljs.org/) - This helped me further understand how bundlers like Parcel operate.
